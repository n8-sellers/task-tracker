# Active Context: Task Tracker Web App

## Current Work Focus
We have completed the implementation of the Task Tracker web application. Our focus is now on:

1. User testing and gathering feedback
2. Potential refinements to the visualization components
3. Considering future enhancements
4. Deployment options

## Recent Changes
- Implemented complete application structure
- Built core functionality for CSV parsing and data storage
- Created responsive UI with dashboard, detail views, and history tracking
- Implemented data visualization components with Chart.js
- Added search and filtering capabilities
- Integrated client-side storage with IndexedDB/localForage

## Next Steps
1. Gather user feedback on the current implementation
2. Consider additional visualization options
3. Explore export functionality for reports
4. Investigate integration with external data sources
5. Optimize performance for large datasets

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Storage Strategy
- Implemented IndexedDB through localForage for efficient client-side storage
- Using versioned uploads to maintain historical data integrity
- Implemented comparison functionality between versions

### UI/UX Approach
- Created clean, minimal interface with card-based dashboard
- Implemented progressive disclosure pattern - show details only when needed
- Established consistent visual language through CSS variables
- Provided table and chart toggle options for different visualization preferences

### Performance Optimizations
- Implemented pagination for large datasets
- Used debouncing for search operations
- Implemented efficient filtering mechanisms
- Optimized chart rendering for better performance

### Data Processing
- Implemented normalization strategy for uploaded CSV data
- Created change detection algorithm between uploads
- Built metrics calculation for dashboard summary cards
- Implemented grouping functions for visualization aggregations

## Current Questions
- How will the application perform with very large CSV files (10,000+ rows)?
- What additional visualization types would be most valuable to users?
- Should we implement server-side storage in a future version?
- What export formats would be most useful (PDF, Excel, etc.)?
