# Product Context: Task Tracker Web App

## Problem Statement
Organizations need to track sales orders from bi-weekly CSV reports to monitor changes over time. Without proper visualization and analysis tools, it's difficult to:
- Identify trends in order data
- Track additions and removals of orders between reports
- Analyze data by location, customer, fabric type, or GPU model
- Access detailed information when needed while maintaining a clean interface

## User Needs
- Efficient upload of bi-weekly CSV data
- Clean, minimal interface for regular monitoring
- Detailed insights when investigating specific locations or orders
- Historical tracking to understand changes over time
- Visualization options for different types of analysis
- Search and filter capabilities for finding specific data points

## Target Experience
The application should feel lightweight and responsive, with an emphasis on:
- **Simplicity**: Clean initial interface focusing on key data
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show more details only when a user requests them
- **Visual clarity**: Clear visualizations that make data patterns immediately apparent
- **Efficient workflows**: Minimize clicks for common tasks
- **Flexibility**: Support different analysis approaches through toggles between charts and tables

## Key Differentiators
- Client-side processing for privacy and speed
- Historical change tracking between bi-weekly reports
- Dual-mode visualization (charts and tables)
- Drill-down capability from summary to details
- Persistent browser storage for offline access
